# dlog
Simple Debug Utility (similar to TJ's debug)

This is still under development (no release yet)

# ToDo
- Need a proper browser window (this) detection - currently a bit hacky
- Basic color rotation with a decent color set
- Would be nice to make this CommonJS compatible for use with Node
- Need to package up with bower
